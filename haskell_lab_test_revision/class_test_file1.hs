--SECTION A - 20 Marks

-- For each named declaration below. Use the comment preceeding
-- it as a guide to creating a comprehension that computes the
-- same value as that displayed in the comment.

-- [8,9,10,11,12]
x1 = [x | x <- [8..12]]

-- [10,20,30,40,50,60]
x2 = [x*10 | x <- [1..6]]

-- -- [(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5)]
x3 = [(x,y) | x <- [1..4], y <- [x+1]]

-- write the sign function that returnss
--  +1 if its argument is positive
--  -1 if its argument is negative
--   0 if its argument is zero
sign x 
    | x == 0 = 0
    | x < 0 = -1
    | x > 0 = 1


-- write the factorial function that multiplies
-- all the numbers less then n. Eg.
-- fact 1 --> 1
-- fact 2 --> 2
-- fact 3 --> 6
-- fact 4 --> 24
-- Hint: use the following scheme
-- 5 ---> [1,2,3,4,5] -> 120
-- The product function will be useful
-- product [1,4,6] ---> 1*4*6 --> 24

fact n = product[1..n]



--SECTION B - 20 Marks
-- For each named expression replace "undefined"
-- with an expression with the same type as the declaration

j1 = ("hello", 42)

j5:: (Integer,String,Integer,Char)
j5 = (42, "hello", 42, 'f')

j6:: ([Char],(Bool,String))
j6 = ([j3,j3], (True, "hello"))

j7:: [[Bool]]
j7 = [[True, True], [False], [False, True]]

j8:: [(String,Bool)]
j8 = [("Hello", True), ("World", False)]

-- SECTION C  - 40 Marks
